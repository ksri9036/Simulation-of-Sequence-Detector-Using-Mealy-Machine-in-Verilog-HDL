# **Simulation of Sequence Detector Using Mealy Machine in Verilog HDL**



## **Aim**
To design and simulate a **Sequence Detector using Mealy Machine** in Verilog HDL that detects a specific bit pattern from a given binary input sequence.
a


## **Apparatus Required**
- Computer with **Vivado Design Suite** installed  

## **Theory**

A **Sequence Detector** identifies a specific sequence of bits from a stream of binary input data.  
**Mealy Machine** – Output depends on both the current state and the input.

In the **Mealy Machine**, the output can change immediately in response to an input, making it faster than the Moore type.  
The Mealy model uses **state transitions** and **output logic** based on both the current state and the input signal.

For example, a **sequence detector** that detects `"1011"`:
- It produces an output `1` whenever the sequence `1011` appears in the input stream.
- Overlapping sequences are also detected.

## Verilog Code
```verilog
module mealysequence(clk,reset,in,out);
    input clk;
    input reset;
    input in;
    output reg out;

    parameter S0 = 3'b000,
              S1 = 3'b001,
              S2 = 3'b010,
              S3 = 3'b011,
              S4 = 3'b100;

    reg [2:0] current_state, next_state;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= S0;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        out = 0;
        case(current_state)
            S0: begin
                if(in) next_state = S1;
                else   next_state = S0;
            end

            S1: begin
                if(in) next_state = S1;
                else   next_state = S2;
            end

            S2: begin
                if(in) next_state = S3;
                else   next_state = S0;
            end

            S3: begin
                if(in) begin
                    next_state = S1;
                    out = 1;
                end
                else   next_state = S2;
            end

            default: next_state = S0;
        endcase
    end
endmodule

```
## Testbench
```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb_mealy;

    reg clk, reset, in;
    wire out;

    mealysequence uut (clk,reset,in,out);

    initial clk = 0;
    always #5 clk = ~clk;

    initial begin
        reset = 1; in = 0;
        #12 reset = 0;

        #10 in=1;
        #10 in=0;
        #10 in=1;
        #10 in=1;

        #10 in=0;
        #10 in=1;
        #10 in=0;
        #10 in=1;
        #10 in=1;

        #50 $finish;
    end
endmodule

```

## Result

The Mealy Machine Sequence Detector for the bit pattern "11011" was successfully designed and simulated using Verilog HDL.
Simulation results confirm that the circuit correctly detects the pattern and supports overlapping sequences.
